# Michen-learning_basics_project-1-

Build Machine Learning Models for Artificial Intelligence: Develop and fine-tune ML models for classification, regression, and clustering.

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks focused on building, training, and analyzing Machine Learning (ML) models for various tasks:
- **Classification**: Assigning labels to data points.
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values.
- **Clustering**: Grouping data points into distinct clusters.

It is a resource for anyone interested in learning ML basics and practical implementation using hands-on examples.

## Features

- Implementations of common supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms.
- Step-by-step guides in Jupyter Notebooks for easy understanding.
- Code and explanations for:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model building and training
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Model evaluation
  - Visualization of results

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhuvana214/Michen-learning_basics_project-1-.git
   cd Michen-learning_basics_project-1-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Most notebooks use Python libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`. Install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If there's no requirements file, install libraries manually as needed.)*

3. **Run Notebooks:**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebooks and follow the instructions in each for exploration and experimentation.
